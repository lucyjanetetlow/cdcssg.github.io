<p>
  Cri du Chat Syndrome is caused by a missing section of the short arm of the fifth
  chromosome (5p-, in medical terms).
</p>

<p>  
  Around 85% of the time it is random, but in 
  around 15% of cases it's inherited from a parent who may <em>have</em> the missing part,
  but not in the right place. This is called a <em>translocation</em>. That's why, as a parent
  of a child with CdCS, it's sensible to get your own chromosomes tested if you are considering
  having more children.
</p>

<p>
  The effects of the syndrome vary a lot, depending on how much of the chromosome is deleted. It's important to note
  that not all the symptoms and treatments listed here will be relevant to all children (or adults) with CdCS.

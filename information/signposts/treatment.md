The syndrome cannot be cured, though children and adults with CdCS will be able to get a variety of different therapies as they grow up. The [therapies](/information/therapies/therapies.html) section gives some information on the most common ones.

### Contacting your GP

It may make GP visits easier if you make your situation clear to your surgery, and see a regular GP who could get to know your child and their needs. Providing them with this information (which you can [download](/downloads/cdcs_route_map.pdf)) may help.

You should also let you GP know if you are a carer for a person with CdCS, as this will affect your own needs.

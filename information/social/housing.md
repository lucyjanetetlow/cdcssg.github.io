If you have impairment or a health condition that makes living alone difficult, making some adaptations to your home or getting extra support may help you to live in your own home.

## Living in your own home

You have the right for your needs to be assessed by the social services department of your local council. Following a health and social care assessment, an occupational therapist may recommend types of equipment and ideas for adapting your home. 

You may be entitled to financial help, such as a Disabled Facilities Grant, to pay for adaptations or improvements to your home. 

See [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-facilities-grants) for more information.

## Independent Living

There are difficult choices to be made as whether adults with CdCS stay with their families or go into independent living or sheltered accommodation; at each stage a multi-agency team (health, social services, educational) will assess the needs of all and come to a decision as to what is the best outcome for the person with CdCS, families and carers.

It may be a good idea to include special provision in your will for your child, or to set up a trust that can manage their financial affairs after your death.

There are many services for making wills and trusts, and we do not recommend any particular group. 

However, [Mencap](http://www.mencap.org.uk/what-we-do/wills-and-trusts) provide a great deal of information on how to make appropriate arrangements, including a national list of solicitors with experience dealing with special needs.

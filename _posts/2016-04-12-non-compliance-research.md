Dr Kate Woodcock from Queen's University Belfast would like your help with her research into non-compliant behaviour in children:

The project is directed by Dr Kate Woodcock (lecturer in atypical development) and her post graduate research student Katherine Grady at the School of Psychology, Queen’s University Belfast. They would like to hear from you if you are a caregiver of a child aged 5-11 years old who frequently:

* Ignore your requests...
* Tries to talk their way out of doing things
* Directly defies you
* Says “no” a lot

While most children behave like this at times, they are looking to speak to caregivers of children who behave like this across different settings (e.g. school and home) and where such behaviours impact their child and family in terms of friendships, socialising etc.  They would like caregivers to take part in an interview over the phone to talk about the  behaviour.

If you are interested in hearing more about the study and would like more information, please contact [kgrady01@qub.ac.uk](mailto:kgrady01@qub.ac.uk) or [k.woodcock@qub.ac.uk](mailto:k.woodcock@qub.ac.uk). You can also call them on 028 9097 4886 (048 9097 4886 from ROI).

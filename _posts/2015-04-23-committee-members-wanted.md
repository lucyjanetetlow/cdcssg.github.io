## Volunteer Committee Members wanted 

The Cri du Chat Syndrome Support Group is managed by a committee and we are currently looking for new members to join us. We are urgently looking for replacements to step into both the Chair and Treasurer roles at the end of the current term and in addition require more ordinary committee members to ensure that YOUR Support Group can continue to evolve.

We have added the job descriptions below, just so you have an idea of what is involved. However what they don't tell you is how much fun being on the committee actually is! So if you are at all interested in joining us and shaping the work that the group does please get in touch for more information. Or we can put you in touch with a current member.

The roles are all volunteer based but we pay reasonable expenses to attend meetings and there is always a good lunch at them. 

If you are interested in any of these roles please contact office@criduchat.org.uk

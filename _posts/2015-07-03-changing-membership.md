You may remember that a while ago, we asked for your thoughts on how the CdC Syndrome Support Group operates. We wanted to understand how we could best secure our future, help as many families as possible, and provide a welcoming community for parents, carers, friends and family of people who have Cri du Chat Syndrome.

One of the biggest changes, and one that was so big we had to have it ratified by our Annual General Meeting, is that we have decided to no longer be a membership based organisation.

The way our CdC family support each other has changed over the last few years. We believe that by moving away from membership towards being open to everyone, we will be able to help even more people and provide our support, networking and advice to all – not just members.

Everything that was previously available to members is now available to anyone affected by CdCS. That includes our regular newsletter, access to the [Clinical Advisory Group](/information/cag.html), the website and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cdcssguk/), and of course our many [local and national events](/events/index.html).

Instead of becoming a member, we're asking people instead to support our work with a regular donation. You can set up a direct debit by clicking below, and anything you can donate helps.

If you were previously a member we hope that you will continue to support us by either leaving your current Standing Order in place, or commit to a regular donation via JustGiving.

Your continued support means the world to us, and really helps us to continue supporting those that need us.

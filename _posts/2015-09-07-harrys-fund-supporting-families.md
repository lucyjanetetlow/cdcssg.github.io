We are delighted that we have been the recipient of a donation from Harry's Fund.  Harry's Fund is a charity set up by the family of Harry Bates, who was born on the 11th February 2008 and at the age of 12 weeks was diagnosed with Cri du Chat syndrome. The charity was set up in June 2011 with the aim of raising awareness of the syndrome and providing support to families with children that suffer from this condition.

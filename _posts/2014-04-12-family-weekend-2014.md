We're excited to announce that this years' family weekend will be held at Chessington World of Adventures, just south of London, on 27-29 June.

Speakers and workshops will be confirmed soon, but it's shaping up to be a great event!

For booking details and prices, take a look at the [Family Weekend 2014](/events/2014/family-weekend.html) page, which has all the details.

See you there!
